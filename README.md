# osu_song_extractor
This is a small shell script that exports the music files from osu!
<br>
To use it, place the shell script in your osu! directory and run it through wsl.
<br>
I created this for fun for personal use and don't plan on improving it, for now.

The improved version is roughly 8 times faster than the old one.
